# Election-Survey-Data-Analysis-Project

This project is a political election survey. The survey data includes responses from participants on various topics, including their demographic information (age,gender,education,income), political preferences (Vote_Now, Past_Vote), and satisfaction with their local government (CM_satisfaction, MLA_satisfaction).

The survey data also includes information on the response ID, collection date, urban/rural location, assembly number, and category, which can be used to further 
analyze and understand the survey results.
